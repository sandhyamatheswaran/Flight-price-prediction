# Flight-price-prediction
   ->The aim of this project is to develop a flight price prediction system using Python.
   ->With the increasing demand for air travel and the dynamic nature of flight prices, accurately predicting flight prices has become a critical need for travelers. 
   ->This project aims to provide an effective solution by utilizing machine learning techniques to predict flight prices based on historical data and other relevant factors. 
   ->Historical flight data will be collected from various sources, such as airline websites, travel agencies.
   ->The proposed flight price prediction system will be a valuable tool for travelers to make informed decisions about flight bookings and optimize their travel expenses. 
   ->The use of machine learning techniques and Python programming will enable accurate and efficient flight price predictions, providing users with a reliable tool for planning their travel budget. 
   ->Several Python tools can be used in flight price prediction project, including-BeautifulSoup,Scrapy,NumPy,Pandas,Scikitlearn,Flask,JupyterNotebook,Spider.Visual studio code for front end development.  
   ->The efficiency of this project will be determined by the accuracy of the prediction model, scalability of the application, computational efficiency, user experience, and ease of updates and maintenance. 
   ->Proper implementation of these factors will contribute to a highly efficient flight price prediction system using Python. 
   ->There are several algorithms that can be used in this project are Linear Regression , Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Gradient Boosting Algorithm.
